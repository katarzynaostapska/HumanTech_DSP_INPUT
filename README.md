Abstract:
The built environment faces challenges of limiting resource consumption and emissions while
addressing growing development demand and low labour productivity problems. This requires
disruptive approaches like circular economy transition and the application of several technolog-
ical enablers to overcome challenges, i.e. smart data acquisition, data fusion, and design for
robotic construction and deconstruction. This work introduces a digital tool for robotic decon-
struction planning of monolithic reinforced concrete structures based on automated extraction
of data from scan-to-BIM at a low level of detail. A script operating on scan-to-BIM defines
element connectivity and geometrical and physical properties for a network graph model used as
the basis for the metaheuristic ant colony optimization implemented to support the scheduling of
human, crane, forklift and robot collaboration tasks. The methodology is explained and tested
on three case studies with different levels of complexity, i.e. two synthetic flat slab structures
and one real scan-to-BIM input. Cutting speed, effective crane utilization and high human labour
cost are the main parameters influencing the optimal deconstruction plan.
